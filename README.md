# Project Title

Car Rental Simulation in Python (Object Oriented Design)

## Description

In the program three linked lists are maintained for cars:

* available for rent – Available,
* rented – Rented,
* in repair – AtWkshop.

The cars on the available list are ordered by mileage, with the car having the least miles at the front of the list. The cars on the rented list are ordered by the expected return dates, with the first car on this list having the earliest expected return date.

The program prompts the user for a transaction code (integer) as follows:
* (1) add a new car to the available-for-rent list,
* (2) add a returned car to the available-for-rent list,
* (3) add a returned car to the repair list,
* (4) transfer a car from the repair list to the available-for-rent list,
* (5) rent the first available car,
* (6) print all the lists,
* (7) quit.
